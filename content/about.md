Hi! Ariel here, the artist behind Ariel's Doodles. I've been creating art for as long as I can remember. I received my bachelor's in Fine Arts from the University of Utah. I love creating things others can enjoy, and I especially love making <a href="/portfolio/#pets">cute pet portraits</a>. <a href="/commissions">Let me know if you want one!</a>
