## Gameplay

### On Your Turn
- At the beginning of your turn put down your Clowder sets face up. If the draw pile is empty, you may build Clowder sets at anytime during your turn.
- If your hand is empty, draw a card ("**Go Kitty!**").
- choose one action:
  - Ask another player for a **Trait** or **Season** card
  - Use/Reactivate a **Pounce Token**.
If the only cards in your hand are Mouse card, you may ask any Season.

### Asking for a Trait Card
1. You must hold at least one card with the Trait you're asking for.
2. If the player has it, they give you **all** their cards of that Trait.  
    - Your turn proceeds (refer to ["On Your Turn"](#on-your-turn)).
3. If not, they say **"Go Kitty"** and you draw a card. Your turn ends.

### Asking for a Season Card
1. You may ask any player for a Season card (Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall), even if you don’t have one in your hand.
2. If the player has it, they give you **one** card. Your turn ends.
3. If not, they say **"Go Kitty"** and you draw a card. Your turn ends.

### Using a Pounce Token
You may only use an active (face-up) Pounce Token.
1. Flip the token face down to mark it as used.
2. Choose one (your turn ends after either choice):
   - A. Ask any player for **any card**, including Mouse Cards (Trait/Season rules still apply). 
      + If the player doesn’t have the card, they say “No Kitty." 
   - B. Look at the top 3 cards of the draw pile, keep one, and place the rest on the bottom.

### Reactivate a Pounce Token
1. You may reactivate a Pounce Token when you lay down a Clowder.
2. You may use your turn to reactivate **one** Pounce Token.

### Mouse Card
- **Reverse a request** if someone asks for a card you have:
  - If they ask for a **Trait**, they give you all their cards of that Trait.  
  - If they ask for a **Season**, they give you one card of that Season.  
  - Discard the Mouse card after use.  
  - Cannot block a request made with a Pounce Token.

- **Wild Card** – Mouse cards may complete any Clowder.  
- Cannot be used to form a set of 4 Mouse cards.

## End of the Game  
- When the draw pile runs out, each player gets one final turn.  
- The player with the most points wins.  
  1. **Tiebreaker:** Most active Pounce Tokens.
